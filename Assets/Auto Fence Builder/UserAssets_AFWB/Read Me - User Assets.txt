Presets
---------
User's saved Presets go in to the main Preset library, and a copy will go here with the [User] prefix.
This makes it possible to locate all User Presets copied into one Sub-menu in the Preset Menu



Naming Convention For User Meshes:

[Pure] = Copy of User's original unmodified mesh. 
[Prep] = Copy Prepared & Optimized for AFWB
