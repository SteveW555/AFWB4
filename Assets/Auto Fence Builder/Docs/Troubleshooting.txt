Troubleshooting:
________________________________________
Shift-Clicking does nothing:
	Ensure Auto Fence Builder is selected in the Hierarchy when trying to build
	
	Ensure Unity Gizmos are enabled in the top-right of the Scene window
	(Not the menu, the Gizmo button  which changes color only very slightly when disabled, so it's easy to miss)

	Ensure you're clicking on a terrain, or a GameObject that has a collider.

	It's possible that Unity can get stuck on the hand tool, 
	it's a known issue with Unity after using some mouse & control key combos Try:
	* Clicking one of the scene view options such as 2D or lighting	
	* Clicking on one of the other tools (move, scale, rotate etc)
	* Enter and exit Play mode

	You might have more than one instance of Auto Fence Builder in your hierarchy.
	This isn't necessary. Use 'Finish & Start New' instead.
	Delete one of them and also check that there aren't duplicate 'Current Fences Folders'

Custom User Objects:
	Objects disappear in Play mode: ensure that Read/Write Enabled is on in your mesh import settings for your custom object,
	then in Auto Fence: Globals->Refresh_Prefabs
