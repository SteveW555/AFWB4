The contents of this folder are required by AFWB to be able to run the application. 
The Contents of the following folders can simply be removed to create a minimal version of AFWB:

_Extras_AFWB, _Posts_AFWB, _Rails_AFWB
AFWB_Meshes, AFWB_Textures, AFWB_Presets.

(A default Unity Cube with Default Material will be used instead, if they are accessed)
